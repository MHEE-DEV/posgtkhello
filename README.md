## üìù Introduction

The **posgtkhello** project serves as a foundational template for developing GTK2 applications using C++. It is designed specifically for PostmarketOS, a Linux distribution aimed at mobile devices. This template simplifies the setup process, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than configuring the environment.

## üöÄ Features

- Simple GTK2 application structure
- Fully configured build system for PostmarketOS
- Easy setup guide for beginners
- Support for ARM and ARMHF architectures
- Ideal for Nokia N900 and other mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- GTK2 development libraries
- CMake (for building the application)
- PostmarketOS environment set up on your device

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MHEE-DEV/posgtkhello.git
   cd posgtkhello
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Depending on your system, you may need to install the GTK2 development libraries. On Debian-based systems, you can run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
   ```

### Building the Application

1. **Create a Build Directory**

   Inside the project directory, create a build folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. **Run CMake**

   Use CMake to configure the project:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

3. **Compile the Application**

   Build the application using:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   After building, you can run the application with:

   ```bash
   ./your_application_name
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once you have built the application, you can start customizing it. The template provides a basic window with a simple "Hello, World!" message. You can modify the `main.cpp` file to add more features or change the UI.

### Example Code

Here‚Äôs a snippet from the `main.cpp` file:

```cpp
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

    GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "Hello, World!");
    g_signal_connect(window, "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);

    gtk_widget_show_all(window);
    gtk_main();

    return 0;
}
```

Feel free to explore the GTK documentation to learn more about creating user interfaces.
